## Steps Completed  ##

Steps 1 - 6 are working as intended.<br>

In order for commands to work properly, the file path in settings.txt must be modified to where the project is on the host computer.<br>

To test, run commands:<br>
	"type" with "messag" as the argument.<br>
	"exec" with "tstpr2" and "tstpr1" as arguments<br>
		"tstpr1" will hang once it's run, stuck in a while(1) loop<br>
